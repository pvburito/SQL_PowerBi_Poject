## PROBLEM STATEMENT
### CHARTS REQUIREMENT

We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends.We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

-- **1.** Daily Trend for Total Orders:
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.

-- **2.** Monthly Trend for Total Orders:
Create a line chart that illustrates the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.

-- **3.** Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:
Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
